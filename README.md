# My Steps - iOS Technical Assignment 

### Installing

Donwload the project and install the pods

```
pod install
```

Run it on a device to get real health data

### Observations

It wasn't clear for me on the assigment if the app should display the last **30 days** or the passed days for the **current month**. I added both modes. In order to switch between them, **tap** on the chart.
